            <h1>The origin of <mark>HTML</mark></h1>
        </center>
        <b>The origin of HTML:</b>dates back to 1980, when the physicist
        <u>Tim <br>Berners-Lee,</u> a worker at CERN (Europen OrgaOrganization for Nuclear <br> Research) proposed a new
        <q>hypertext</q>system for sharing documents.
        <hr>
        The <q>hypertext</q><sub>systems</sub>
        had been <mark>developer</mark> years before. <br>
        In the field of information technology, the
        <q>hypertext</q> <sup>allowed</sup> users to <br> access information related to the electronic documents they
        were <br>
        viewing.
        <hr>In a certain way, the primitive <u><q>hypertext</q></u> systems could be <br> assimilated to the links of
        the current
        web pages.
        <hr>After completing the development of its "hypertext" system, <u>Tim <br> Berners-Lee </u>presented it to a
        <br> call
        organized to develop a <q>hypertext</q> system for the <strike>Internet</strike>.
         <hr>After joining forces <mark>with <sup>systems</sup> engineer Robert Cailliau,</mark> they <br> presented the
        winning
        proposal called World Wide Web (W3). <br>
        The first formal document with the description of HTML was published <br> in <u>1991 <sub>under</sub> the name
            HTML Tags
            (HTML tags)</u> and can still be <br> consulted online today as a <u><q>computer relic</q></u>
